Terms & Conditions

By enrolling to this system you activate a mechanism that acquires
a number of photographs that are stored and processed in order to
extract biometric data which would be used to train the system to
automatically recognize you in the future. You will also be asked
for your name which will be linked to this biometric data in order
for the system to identify you when it sees you. This data is considered
sensitive personal information and its acquisition and processing falls under
the GDPR rules framework for data protection. These data belongs to YOU.
It does not give us any right to process or share these data except for the
purposes of proving the functionality of this system. Two months after system
demonstration your image data and its derivatives including any links to your
name will be permanently deleted.
We need your permission to do things like acquiring pictures of you,
processing your biometric information and name, for the purpose of this
system to automatically recognise you and indicate your identity.
You must give us your permission to do this and this permission
extends to that your data will be used only locally solely for the purposes
of this project and not be shared in any way.
